# 📊 Store Sales Forecasting
## 📄 Project Overview
This project aims to develop an accurate and effective sales forecasting model for Walmart, one of the world’s largest retail chains. Given Walmart's scale, it faces unique challenges in managing inventory, operations, and meeting customer demand effectively. Our team— **Aditya Mukhopadhyay**, **Ankit Kumar** and **Sanjay Kumar** —seeks to tackle these issues by building a forecasting solution that adapts to the dynamic retail environment.

## ⚙️ Problem Context
### 🏢 Walmart's Scale and Challenges
- **Global Reach**: Operating at a global scale, Walmart encounters numerous challenges in aligning inventory levels with fluctuating demand, balancing supply with sales, and optimizing operational efficiency.
### 🌍 The Dynamic Retail Industry
- **Influencing Factors**: The retail industry is affected by various factors including:
    - Seasonal Trends
    - Holidays
    - Promotions
    - Economic Conditions
    These factors significantly influence customer buying patterns, making accurate forecasting essential.

### 📈 Importance of Accurate Sales Forecasting
-   Supply-Demand Balance: Ensures Walmart can meet customer demand without excess inventory.
-   Cost Management: Reduces overstocking, minimizing holding costs and markdowns.
-   Customer Satisfaction: Avoids stockouts, preventing lost sales and enhancing customer satisfaction.

### 🚀 Project Goals
1. Build a robust forecasting model that adapts to dynamic retail trends.
2. Reduce holding costs and markdowns by predicting accurate inventory needs.
3. Prevent stockouts to maximize customer satisfaction and retention.

### Project Prerequisites
1. Python Interpreter >3.8(preferably 3.12) 
2. VScode IDE or any preferable IDEs(The steps are aligned with VSCode)

### Steps to Replicate this project in Local
1. Make sure you have the project prerequisites installed in your system
2. Clone the repository into a VSCode window
3. Make sure you are in the root folder of this repository
4. Install Jupyter plugins (Note: VSCode suggests it once you open one of the ipynb files inside code directory)
5. Create a virtual environment with your Python Interpreter
6. Activate your venv using ```source .venv/bin/activate```
7. Run ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt``` 
8. Once the dependencies are installed you can dive into each of the .ipynb files to learn more about each step in detail
9. The ideal Flow should be EDA -> model_implementation -> model_evaluation
